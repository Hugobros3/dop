 And yes the game is ugly as fuck. My bad.
 
 == MUSIC / SOUND DESIGN ==

 No music yet.
 
 == INSPIRATION ==
 
 This game is obviously greatly inspired by the
 well-known "Nintendo Wars" series ( Aka Advance wars ).
 
 It uses a graphical and sound design
 similar to what we had in the 16-bit era,
 more specifically SNES games.
 
 Being a former Minecraft modder I got inspired by
 it's code and way of doing things for some aspects
 of the game ( sectors, network manager, gui system )
 
 It is also inspired by many elements from some
 typical management and strategy games.
 
 == HOSTING AND WEB SERVICES ==
 
 The dev-machine was a dedicated server form OVH.com
 then a cheap VPS from firstheberg.org, wich had the
 "funny" particularity of crashing for days whitout rebooting.
 
 == BETA-TESTING ==
 
 The following users were granted the right to play 
 the game before everyone else :
 
 Poulet_Salade
 Kisuma
 Honk
 Solas
 Djowkerz
 ShootingStyle
 CeasarUp
 jade280
 GodEneru
 Arcafeux
 Asathur
 Anate
 dpshark
 Tomcat
 MissJuliette
 
 Even if some of them didn't play the game much, some
 showed great support towards me and therefore helped a lot.
 
 == CODE HELP ==
 
 Libraries used are inspired by the famous notch
 who used the same for almost all of his games, and
 notably for "Minecraft". Being a former Minecraft
 modder I learned a lot doing that and got used
 to those libs and Java.
 
 == LIBRARIES USED ==
 
 LWJGL - LightWeight Java Game Library
 http://lwjgl.org
 
 Java 3D sound system by Paul Lamb
